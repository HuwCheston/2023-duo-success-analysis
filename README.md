# README

Experiment code for small-scale perceptual study of the factors that contribute to a successful musical performance 
over a network. The video data used in this study comes from our corpus of networked performances by professional
jazz duos (keyboard and drums); see the DOI. 

Participants are shown a randomised sequence of performances from the corpus and asked simply to rate how successful 
they are, on a linear scale of 1 to 9 (with 1 = extremely unsuccessful, 9 = extremely successful).
